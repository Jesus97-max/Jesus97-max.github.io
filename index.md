## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
 

* Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because in part 1 it involved the measuring tools we use to cook. I found it interesting as we implemented those measurements like tablespoons, cups, and ounces because I use them very often. Part-2 was also very fun because we were able to code while implementing the high/low guessing game in the program. 

* Lab 8 was also one of my favorite labs because in part-1 my program fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. It was really simple but fun when executing the order. Part-2 was also very captivating since the program calculated the average of numbers given as command-line arguments. 

* Lab 9 was my favorite lab because in part-1 we learned how judges score the averages of the contestants of the Olympics. The program calculates the average score exactly like the judges. Part-2 was also fun because it involved making sure if two strings “eating” and “sleeping”, formed a valid schedule for two different philosophers.
