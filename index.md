## My Favorite CPSC 120 Labs
 
* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs for the reason that in part 1, it involved the measuring tools we use to cook. I found it interesting as we implemented those measurements like tablespoons, cups, and ounces since I use them very often when prepping a meal. Part-2 was also very enjoyable due to being able to code, while implementing the high/low guessing game in the program. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was also one of my favorite labs because in part-1 my program fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. It was really simple but fun when executing the order as there were many different kinds of orders. Part-2 was also very captivating since the program calculated the average of numbers given as command-line arguments. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was my favorite lab for the fact that in part-1 we learned how judges score the averages of the contestants of the Olympics. The program calculates the average score exactly like the judges do for the Olympics. Part-2 was also entertaining since it involved making sure if two strings “eating” and “sleeping”, formed a valid schedule for two different philosophers.
